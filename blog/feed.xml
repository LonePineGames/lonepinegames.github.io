I didn’t implement any big features this week. (Okay, I implemented one big feature.) I did some bug fixing, including an issue that prevented players with older machines from launching the game. I added some information explaining the heatmaps better, including showing the effect of coasts and hills on land value from the start of the game. I also fixed the game balance, which was broken by the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://lonepine.io/blog/2019/10/18/scale.html&quot;&gt;heatmaps change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Land near water or on hills is more valuable.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three key aspects of New Cities gameplay balance: money, economics, and heatmaps. Money includes loans, taxes, and costs; economics includes the conditions that cause citizens and businesses to enter or leave the city; and heatmaps—well, they’re a bit tricky to balance. I wanted Mitch to be able to play with the balance and give me feedback, so I moved the heatmap tuning constants into a Lua file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until now, the game has been 100% C++ (and GLSL). Setting numerical constants in C++ code is inflexible. I was thinking of putting the constants in JSON or YAML, but someone on Discord mentioned modding, so I decided to check out Lua. It wasn’t hard to integrate the language, and by the time I had a system to load constants from Lua, I was already thinking about systems that would enable modding. Though we can assign no definitive dates, modding is now a planned feature.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many features that would benefit from being configured in Lua. Amenities (parks, schools, stadiums, hospitals) are unlocked with achievements, but there is no way currently to add a custom achievement or unlock a custom amenity. I’d like to move the achievements to Lua, and configuring amenities could live there too. A few game-balance related functions could possibly be exported to Lua, including computing the taxable value of a building, determining when a person should move out of the city (or move in), and determining when a business should close. I’m not sure if I want to move these things to Lua due to possible performance issues, but we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

We’re still a good distance away from a public early access release, taking this time to polish up the game and make it as good as we possibly can, but that doesn’t mean you won’t get your chance to play it sooner rather than later. Here’s the story of how we got here, and where we’re going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing a game is a journey. Like a Hobbit fresh out of the Shire, the twists and turns that lie in wait could scarcely be anticipated from the moment you set out on your quest. You have an idea of where you are and where you’re going, but there’s a wide world of wonder and worry that stands between developers and a release candidate. If you’re reading this blog, we consider you to be a part of the Fellowship, so let’s take a look at the path before us—both where we’ve been and where we’re going, together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2017, Lone Pine set out to make a regional traffic system simulator. He implemented the basic road building and “vehicle physics” systems, and then zoning and building spawning, followed by simulated citizens to populate the traffic network. Having built a basic city builder, or “city planner” as we call it, he named it New Cities, and by early 2019, was ready to engage fans with the nascent game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Cities was officially announced in April of 2019, with hopes that we would have an early access version prepped and ready to go by Summer. Obviously, that didn’t happen—we got a little sidetracked in Moria. But we learned a lot, and development continues at a steady pace up through the present day. Internal alpha builds are coming together, team members are testing, and new features like &lt;a href=&quot;https://lonepine.io/blog/2019/10/25/planning-for-success.html&quot;&gt;blueprints&lt;/a&gt; are being implemented on the regular.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Watching a small town become educated.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve retraced our steps, let’s talk about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been prepping an IndieGoGo campaign to reward you, the Fellowship, with unique opportunities for your support, and to gather a squad of heroic alpha testers. Plans are to launch the crowdfunding campaign by the end of this year (watch this space for updates) but we can offer you a sneak peak at what is to come right here in the New Cities Tribune! We’ve got a few tiers for you to choose from. Of course, the exact combination of tiers and rewards may change, but this is what we’ve got on the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “House” tier comes with the opportunity to put your name in the credits right beside the developers, as a special thanks for your support, along with access to an exclusive channel and role on our Discord. You’ll have the ear of the development team; use this newfound power wisely. And, random citizens of cities will be named after you! (With your permission of course.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next tier, Apartment Complex, gives you access to the Closed Alpha (for the first 100 contributors), a New Cities Game Key on final release, and the opportunity to vote in a New Feature poll to shape the next leg of our journey. But like any good mayor, perhaps you want to keep building onward and upward from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Factory tier, you become the proud owner of a New Cities T-Shirt, along with additional votes in New Feature polls to ensure your voice is heard. You’ll get a chance to shape the future of the game—we need your feedback to make it the best it can be! As a special thanks, schools, parks and roads will be named in your honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Office Complex tier is more of a good thing. You’ll get a 3D-printed model of the skyscraper. Also, your voting power is upped to fifteen votes in the New Feature polls, so you can rest comfortably in the knowledge that the future of New Cities is being shaped by dapper and wise patrons such as yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final tier, Skyscraper, is for the true city builder fanatic. You’ll get an opportunity to have a 30 minute conversation with the developer to discuss features and gameplay and to suggest new content. In addition to all of the above, you get a massive one hundred votes in the New Feature polls, and top-tier naming in the credits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the tier you choose, your support is essential for indie developers like ourselves. We can’t thank you enough for your interest in New Cities, and should you choose to go above and beyond by supporting us during the IndieGoGo campaign, we truly consider you a part of our Fellowship. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what lies beyond, you wonder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January of 2020, those who backed an IndieGoGo tier which includes access to the Closed Alpha will be able to place their first roads down on the map as the Alpha goes live. You’ll have a few months to yourself to play, experiment, and offer your feedback on the game. You’ll vote in regular polls to decide which new features to implement first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of Spring 2020, we’ll push the game live into early access so that all who aspire to raise a city of concrete, asphalt, and steel from the humble soil can manifest their dreams into reality. Then we have a period of refinement—of polish, adding features, and tuning systems. By 2021, if all goes well, the first release candidate for New Cities will be ready, and version 1.0 will follow soon after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we can’t thank you enough for your support. Indie developers live and die by the passion and enthusiasm of their players, and we are blessed to be a part of the city builder community—easily one of the best in the gaming industry. We’re excited to launch our IndieGoGo, and to show off more New Cities in the coming months. Keep an eye on this space for updates, and as always…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy building!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;This is why cloverleaf interchanges are bad #BanTheClover&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few years, I was highly addicted to the fantastic game &lt;a href=&quot;https://factorio.com/&quot;&gt;Factorio&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately for you, that addiction has subsided, and now I’m addicted to The Programming Game instead. Factorio’s endgame is amazing because of just how much happens in a giant factory — belts, trains and flying robots, oh my! – and how much they’ve done to maximize the performance. A modern gaming PC can easily run what’s called a “1KSPM” factory; that is, a factory that produces 1000 of each type of science per minute. This requires launching an orbital-class rocket, the most expensive item in the game, every single minute. By &lt;a href=&quot;https://kirkmcdonald.github.io/calc.html#zip=fZJBjsMgDEVvk1WRkmYXicO44CZWwSBjpJk5fYkyi2mHdGPk/z74yyIS23m4YVCLX1mwFKMCXHISNbs8+GjzPPibLXt1droOpBiLLRkcmuIIuZ2teSyyTOM4XjZaN6Poti7Nknx1Som7OFIgBfnuwr+ambvqtatOv+oQ2/CAe3pEb45u4RrCW7kUUAwtyglNAaQ9zfiODg7O1VgDaJIuF/DQJ5lyfyQGdCrkzL0Kt9Wf3EZxxKuRVNkXE2GFH+K++U6CIPGzaRVk8CesstEqgvo5cSTeM3mhf6bDSVxQFPsbef2QPcsT&quot;&gt;my math&lt;/a&gt; that 1KSPM factory produces and consumes at least 100,000 plates of iron per minute, and each of those plates must be transported on a belt (or robot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a performance perspective, an item on a belt is not very different from a car on a highway, so Factorio convinced me that cities with hundreds of thousands of cars zipping around should be possible with today’s hardware. This inspired me to shoot for the moon with my game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I playtest, I experience a lot of the early game – too much! Right now, I need a way to quickly skip past the early game so I can design the giant cities I dream of, while testing the performance and game balance of the mid-to-late game. Building neighborhoods is fun, but it is also the most time consuming part of the game. To accelerate this process, I borrowed a feature from Factorio: Blueprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;video caption-top&quot;&gt;
  &lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; poster=&quot;/blog/assets/images/clover-copy.png&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Duplicate an interchange with just a few clicks.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blueprints are easy to capture – just click, select, and click again. They can be named and saved to a separate file, allowing you to reuse them across all your cities. Blueprints capture roads and expressways, as well as zoned lots and amenities like schools and parks, allowing you to make repeatable neighborhood layouts. They can be rotated, of course, and can also be flipped (or mirrored) – a feature that was frustratingly absent from Factorio! And, of course, Blueprints can be exported to the clipboard and shared with the New Cities community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious use case for blueprints is highway interchanges. In all city builders and transportation sims, interchanges are tricky to make, especially in the standard game mode (non-sandbox). Players hate to tear up their beautiful city to open up planning space that might not even be used in the final design. Terrain and the surrounding city can complicate the design. Worse, every misclick and poor decision is an impact on your budget. If only you could just plan your interchange, and verify it’s correctness, before you buy it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each highway ramp, you usually try multiple paths before finding the one that meets the game rules and doesn’t collide with other roads, meaning you have to build, delete, and try again. In other games, deleted roads leave strange little hills and pits in the landscape. In New Cities, the terrain remembers its original shape. When you delete a road, it’s like it was never there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want players to trade off price, space and throughput when considering an interchange design. That will only happen if players can easily test different designs without paying for them or cluttering the space. Blueprints, Planner Mode, and Test Mode make this possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Test Mode you can design and test interchanges – or any other road system – with an unlimited budget. With the Blueprints Tool, you can copy a perfected design from Test Mode into your city. Combined with Planner Mode, you can remove any colliding objects, account for terrain, connect to existing roads, and see the price, all before making the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most cities will only feature a few interchanges, if any, but Blueprints are not a niche feature. The real value of the tool is neighborhood designs, which allow you to plop residential space for thousands of people very quickly. Blueprinting also accelerates the laying out of farmlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;video caption-top&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Living space for thousands - just plop it down!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed that New Cities strips out a lot of traditional city-builder features. Currently, there is no power nor water, no fires nor natural disasters (and therefore no fire stations), and certainly no dead bodies or individually-simulated blobs of sewage. These aspects are omitted because I don’t find them interesting. Utilities add no interesting choices to the game – either your city has utilities, or it doesn’t work as a city. These aspects add developer time, slow down the player, and take up CPU cycles that I’d rather use to make the maximal cities larger. (Power is an exception, since coal vs nuclear vs green is an interesting choice, and so power could be included if crowdfunding contributors ask for it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Cities aims to provide a different kind of game, one that is at the same time new and old-as-in-retro, eliminating things that don’t work or are less interesting, and replacing them with mechanics that are fun and new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, and welcome to the first edition of The New Cities Tribune: the periodical where we lay bare the development process, offer our thoughts on game design, and open the floor to you, our most invaluable and esteemed community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’ll be talking about our favorite city builders, and just what it is about them that resonates with us. So kick back, relax, and join us on this little journey, won’t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image caption-bottom&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s something magical about the city builder. The modern gaming landscape is increasingly saturated with competitive games, flush with adrenaline and high-octane thrills as you pit your wits and reflexes against those of other human opponents. Not to knock such games—I enjoy Destiny 2’s Crucible and Counter-Strike as much as the next red-blooded gamer—but it’s nice to remember from time to time that our favorite hobby has so many disparate and varied facets that keep it fresh and lively. There are games that invigorate, as well as games that relax and allow one to unwind at the end of the day. City builders have set the standard since the early days when it comes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/166972/cognitive_flow_the_psychology_of_.php&quot;&gt;cognitive flow&lt;/a&gt;, where we lose all track of time accomplishing goal after goal, some presented by the game but most of which we set for ourselves. Wrapped up in the process—that is, until we glance at the clock and wonder where the hours went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image caption-bottom&quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot from Foundation by Polymorph Games, another fine indie city builder currently in Early Access&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of demanding that we destroy, city builders invite us to create. To solve problems, manage resources, and build new cities. I won’t go so far as to say that these experiences are rare, but they’re not something you see triple-A development studios focusing on anymore. It falls to us, the indie developers, to make the sort of games and experiences we really want to see. Hopefully, if you’re reading this, it’s what you’re looking for too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings us back to the question poised at the beginning: what is it about city builders that really resonates with us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the late, great Bob Ross says about painting: “You have unlimited freedom on this canvas.” And I believe that’s true of certain games as well—you’re given a canvas, and the developer provides all the tools and colors you need to paint a beautiful picture. A portrait of life. And perhaps there’s no portrait so grand or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/23536922667/sonder&quot;&gt;sonderous&lt;/a&gt; as the city, the hub of humanity since ages past. When we abandoned nomadic existence in favor of banding together into communities, cities soon followed, laying the foundation for both scientific endeavors and cultural growth. Humankind condensed like raindrops in a cloud into cities across the globe, each person adding color or vibrance to the glow of these beacons of civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;video caption-below&quot;&gt;

    &lt;source src=&quot;https://github.com/LonePineGames/lonepinegames.github.io/releases/download/v0.3.1/sonder.webm&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;There’s nothing quite so wistful or sonderous as looking out over a city at night&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cities represent a microcosm of the human experience, a vertical slice-of-life in which we live, work, and play. They can be as good or as bad as the people who run them—so when given the opportunity, we jump at the chance to prove ourselves to be good stewards of our canvases. We relish the opportunity to manage budgets, please our citizens with strong educational systems, construct beautification projects like parks and plazas, and watch the digital people under our care grow and thrive. There’s a nurturing soul within us all, and there are no better places to practice those instincts than simulation games where you’re asked to create instead of destroy. To build up instead of tear down. And every moment we spend racking our brains for solutions to traffic congestion or finding ways to increase revenue without raising taxes encourages such outside-the-box problem solving in our own lives. It provides a brain exercise that you can’t help but feel enriched by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to pull back from the world once in a while, recharge your batteries, and paint on your canvas—using whatever medium you find most satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now it’s time we heard from you—via &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/udgeB2E&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/New_Cities&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lone_pine_games&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, pick your favorite platform and sound off. What’s your favorite city builder, and why? What about it ignites that spark of satisfaction and joy within you? What would you suggest we could do to bring that spark to life in New Cities? While we can’t promise you that every suggestion will make it into the game, rest assured that we are listening. We want to make sure you have the paints and the canvas you need to paint something truly beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time, happy building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major limitation is practical terrain size. The terrain is divided into chunks, and most of the cities you’ve seen in videos and screenshots so far have been 25x25 chunks. Previously, it would take a long time to render the terrain, largely because each tree was individually meshed. Terrain trees are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Rendering#Instancing&quot;&gt;instanced&lt;/a&gt;. I also improved the system to randomly place the trees so that they fill the space better, making the forests look denser. The game also now generates high- and low-poly meshes for the terrain for different zoom levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before, my machine (which is high-end) would struggle at 50x50 and was unplayable at 100x100. Now I have 50x50 as the default and 125x125 is completely playable. I tested at 200x200 and reached RAM/VRAM limitations; therefore going beyond 150x150 would require some sort of just-in-time re-rendering of terrain so it wouldn’t have to be stored in memory at all times, and possibly a third tier of mesh resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image caption-top&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;--&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/assets/images/map_size_comparison.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/images/map_size_comparison.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map sizes compared -- 25x25, 50x50, 100x100, and 125x125&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Map sizes compared -- 25x25, 50x50, 100x100, and 125x125&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each chunk is 25 tiles, and each tile is 25 meters, so a chunk is 625 meters on its side. This means that a 100x100 map is 62.5 kilometers, or 38.8 miles, on it’s side. Therefore, a 100x100 map could cover Los Angeles from Santa Monica to Anaheim and Pasadena to Huntington Beach. The San Francisco Bay Area from Berkeley to San Jose and east to Pleasanton would fit quite comfortably in 125x125. 62.5km is just enough to fit the M25 highway which rings London, and all five boroughs of New York would fit in that space too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also improved heatmap performance and save performance. The heatmap performance is dependent on map size. I lowered the resolution of the heatmaps by a factor of 5, meaning a 25x improvement in heatmap performance. As for saving, previously the autosave on large maps caused a slight stutter (100+ms long frame.) I introduced a memory buffer so that saving could be done asynchronously. I also added compression to the save file format, reducing file sizes by a factor of 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, we’re only talking about terrain size here, and in its current form the game couldn’t represent the traffic and activity in a city the size of London or LA. There are three kinds of activities which take a lot of processing: building construction/upgrading, vehicle simulation, and routing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Displaying many buildings at once. Instanced rendering dramatically improves performance.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is constantly trying to add new buildings everywhere there is a zoned lot. It randomly chooses a lot and one of the building designs and tests to see if the design would be a good fit. It tests if there is reasonably flat terrain, no roads in the way, and that the heatmap has the right density and land value for the design. If there are colliding buildings, it tallies the value of those buildings and compares it to the proposed replacement. Improving the performance is really about choosing the right frequency to try adding a new building, as well as making more intelligent guesses for what building goes where. The goal of the game is to make a skyscraper spawn, and therefore this trial-and-error building-spawning process is a very important game mechanic. It will be iterated upon going into the closed alpha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vehicle simulation will be improved in a future update. The current sim can scale to ten of thousands cars, but struggles at the highest game speed. I expect to produce a 5x improvement in this system when I make the improvement. Additionally, there are certain bugs which cause cars to jam up and stop moving. I’ve already experimented with different ways to prevent jams while improving vehicle sim performance. One possible approach is multithreading and reduced simulation resolution with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening&quot;&gt;tweening&lt;/a&gt; for on-screen cars. Vehicle simulation must be deterministic, and mixing multithreading with strict determinism can be messy. Nonetheless, I’m confident I can make it work. There will be a Friday Facts on this topic in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for routing, the solution that has worked so far is caching, and I expect more caching will get us a long way, if not all the way to San Jose. Currently routing is done using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm&quot;&gt;A*&lt;/a&gt;. One issue is that the cache is not saved to disk, which causes poor performance immediately after loading a large city, but that will be rectified soon. Once I’ve exhausted the benefits of caching, I’ll have to look at more sophisticated routing and graph-processing algorithms. I’m curious how services like Google Maps are optimized. I assume they do a great deal of pre-processing, caching and aggregation. Inevitably I will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These improvements mean two things: for those with high-end computers, you’ll be able to play larger maps and bigger cities without any FPS drop. For those with lower-end or older computers, this might grant you the ability to play the game at all, with an FPS that’s acceptable. My dream is a game that can support region scale cities, and I will make that dream a reality – promise!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A stack interchange&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cities are really about transportation. People choose where to live based on estimated travel time to work, school, or amenities. “Research&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nascsp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/issuebrief-benefitsofruralpublictransportation.pdf&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has shown that ease of access to transport has a stronger influence on whether someone will earn more than their parents did, than the level of crime in their area or whether they grew up in a two-parent household,” according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/fwjwePe-HmA&quot;&gt;Wendover Productions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Cities features many kinds of roads, from tree-lined boulevards to high-speed expressways to traffic-corralling one way streets, from stop signs to stop lights to stack interchanges. But currently the only kinds of transportation in New Cities are private automobiles and freight trucks. There are no buses, bikes, pedestrians, trains, airplanes, boats, or even carpools – yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the crowdfunding champaign, there will be a contributors-only vote to determine which new features to prioritize, and most of the candidate features will be related to transportation – so don’t worry, your inner train geek will be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;video caption-below&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Designing an expressway ramp in Planner Mode, which allows you to evaluate road designs before paying for them.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to lay the groundwork for these many modes of transit, I needed to refactor and improve “the graph.” The graph is the internal representation of the road system. In the language of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory&quot;&gt;graph theory&lt;/a&gt;, the intersections and junctions are “nodes” and the road segments connecting them are “edges”. Each edge connects two nodes, and each node to can connect up to six edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image caption-below&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--&lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/2036/&quot;&gt;--&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/2036/&quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;XKCD 2036&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are only roads and expressways, but in the future this system might represent train tracks, bus routes, airways, and sea lanes. Underneath the graph is the lane system, which tells vehicles where to go. Lanes are also used for routing. The lane system is managed automatically by the game based on modifications of the graph. Sidewalks, bike lanes and HOV lanes would be implemented as special kinds of lanes on roads and expressways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you place an edge (road), the game detects any place where that edge crosses another. It then “splits” both edges by placing a node (intersection) between them. When placing one segment of road, there might be a dozen splits or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it gets even more complicated. The roads are split in order to conform to the elevation of terrain. Then there is Planner Mode, which allows you to plan roads before paying for them, and this means that splits must keep track of whether roads are completed or just planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;video caption-top&quot;&gt;
  &lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; poster=&quot;/blog/assets/images/splits.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;https://github.com/LonePineGames/lonepinegames.github.io/releases/download/v0.3.0/splits.mp4&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;https://github.com/LonePineGames/lonepinegames.github.io/releases/download/v0.3.0/splits.webm&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;How splits work&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the splits are all resolved, intersections must be geometrically arranged, illegal states must be detected (underwater, too steep, etc), and costs must be computed. Terrain must be leveled, buildings must also be leveled, buildings and lots must be reassigned, new zone-able lots must be allocated, and the lane system must be updated. Finally, everything has to be rendered to screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game has to do all of this in less than 16.667 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph was the very first thing I implemented, and therefore was most in need of a refactor. There were three issues I addressed with this refactor. Firstly, there were performance issues. I improved performance by making sure that things like rendering happened only once per frame, not once per split. (Performance issues are usually caused by redundant work.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it was possible to accidentally create duplicate, overlapping road segments (two roads connecting the same two intersections). This not only looked ugly but caused further glitches. Now when you overlap one road with another, it upgrades or modifies that section of road instead. In addition, building-by-overlap corrects the direction of one-way roads and expressways, meaning you can change the direction of a long stretch of one-way road using just two clicks – a really powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;video caption-top&quot;&gt;
  &lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; poster=&quot;/blog/assets/images/one-way-switch.png&quot;&gt;

    &lt;source src=&quot;https://github.com/LonePineGames/lonepinegames.github.io/releases/download/v0.3.0/one-way-switch.webm&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Reversing the direction of a one-way road while upgrading it to four lanes and installing traffic lights -- all with just two clicks.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, it was difficult to predict where intersections would happen. Sometimes roads would go under or over each other unexpectedly. When you actually did want an overpass, sometimes you’d get an intersection instead.  This was particularly frustrating when building expressways. Now the game computes and displays splits as you’re placing the road, making connection points clear. It also computes and displays an accurate price tag for the road you’re about to place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transportation is really at the core of New Cities, and building roads is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gameanalytics.com/blog/how-to-perfect-your-games-core-loop.html&quot;&gt;core gameplay loop&lt;/a&gt;. I’m very glad that I’ve made these improvements. This project is moving forward at HOV lane speeds, so I’m thankful that you’re riding carpool with me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;This post is about sound, so here's a pretty image.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, it wasn’t in my plans for the game to have sound by the time it went to early access. It’s not that I didn’t want sound, but it wasn’t a priority. I can’t recall ever having played a game without sound (or without music), but I also never felt like it was the most important part of any game. For a thousand-hour game, most players will mute the game music at some point and listen to their own music, or a podcast, etc. This week I implemented environmental sounds in the game, and I’m happy to say that I was wrong about it’s importance – sound makes the game a much more complete audio-visual experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music was never a talent of mine and I never learned to play an instrument. I had planned to make connections with a musician and either licence their music or have them compose music for the game. However, when it came time to make a trailer, I hadn’t made any such connection. I strongly believe that a good trailer needs music, so I had to find something. I eventually tried composing music using MuseScore. MuseScore is an application to write songs using a virtual sheet music interface – almost like a front-end to MIDI. After the trailer was released, I was approached by musicians offering to compose music for the game. However, I’m quite proud of the music I’ve made and I plan to make more. I’m also thinking about using Audacity to add samples and effects to the music, in order to make it more full and less “MIDI-like”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video game music is usually built around melodic chord progressions which are plesant enough to not be tedious when repeated for a long time. I still haven’t figured out the arcane rules of chord progressions, but fortunately people who do understand them have written chord progression generators that can easily be found through Google. All of the game music is created by starting with one of these progressions, and then just repeating, modifying, and playing with the pattern of notes and beats to make it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;The main menu. I also added clouds to the skybox this week.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had music implemented in the game, it was easy enough to add user interface sound effects (a click sound when you place a road, for example). But for a while there were no environmental sounds. This week I changed that. I’ve implemented a pretty immersive sound environment. There are ambient sounds of traffic, human activity, and life in the city. There are also sounds for the wind, rain, water, and wildlife. I even added a fun retro floppy disk sound when the game starts and on save/load. These additions really add a lot to the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan for New Cities to be your next thousand-hour game. To meet that standard, you’ll need to have a positive immersive experience within the first hour. Even if you mute the game after a day or two, your brain will remember that immersiveness. This will keep the game enjoyable for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m going to start posting weekly updates on the project to keep you guys informed of what’s going on, what features are being worked on, and our progress on the road to release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;A small town, just shy of the 20,000 people needed to officially be a city.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re new here, I’m working on a city builder called New Cities. Over the last year, I’ve developed a basic city builder with a traffic simulation and customizable 3D rendered buildings. In the past few months I’ve fully implemented “The Prosperity System” which will define the game. It’s a dynamic economic model where neighborhoods thrive or fail based on access to work, shopping, parks, and schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;--&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/assets/images/prosperity.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/images/prosperity.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Prosperity heatmap. There are two prosperous areas, one around the city center and the other around a small shopping area.&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Prosperity heatmap. There are two prosperous areas, one around the city center and the other around a small shopping area.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is based around six “heatmaps”. The heatmaps are Pollution, Crime, Education, Prosperity, Value, and Density. Essentially, Education (plus a good road system) creates Prosperity, Prosperity (among other things) creates Value, and Value (plus Prosperity) creates Density. However, Density creates Crime and Pollution, which have a negative impact on Prosperity and Value, creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback&quot;&gt;negative feedback loop&lt;/a&gt;. Negative feedback loops are important to me, since they counteract the explosive nature of positive feedback loops which turn many simulation games into sandboxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;--&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/assets/images/value.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/images/value.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Value heatmap. There are two high-value areas around the city center and a shopping area. The red in the top right is a low value area, since there isn't a school in that neighborhood. The white buildings are schools.&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a player, you have two options. You can buy very expensive city services (schools, parks, police stations, etc) to cut through the negative feedback loop. Alternately, you can build a broad, flat, suburban city, with the intention to grow a dense city center later in the game. I call these two approaches “San Francisco vs Los Angeles.” I consider this to be a kind of morality system, creating the opportunity for different playstyles and different cities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this game, a city doesn’t just linearly grow. Instead the community behaves like a living organism, emerging out of chaos and always at risk of dying. You’ll have to shepherd your city through randomized recessions in the national economy as well as the consequences of any blunders you make. It will be a more random game than previous city builders, with a more vulnerable budget maintaining a fundamentally unstable economic system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be starting crowdfunding in the next two months. One of the tier rewards will be to participate in a closed alpha, which we hope to start before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
